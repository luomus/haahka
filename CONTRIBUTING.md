# Contributing

### Fixing typos

Small typos or grammatical errors in documentation may be edited so long as the
changes are made in the _source_ file.

### Prerequisites

Before you make a substantial pull request, you should always file an issue and
make sure someone from the team agrees that itâ€™s a problem.

### Pull request process

*  We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).
*  New code should follow the style used in the project.
*  For user-facing changes, add a section to the top of `NEWS.Rd` below the
current development version header describing the changes made followed by your
username, and links to relevant issue(s)/PR(s).
