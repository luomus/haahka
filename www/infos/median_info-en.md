### Migration median date

#### What does the graph show?

Median describes the half-way point of migration, or the date when half of the individuals of the spring or autumn migration have been observed. By comparing the migration median dates, it is easy to examine whether the spring and/or autumn migration times of a given species have been shifting.

#### How are the values calculated?

Depending on the species and its migration dynamics, the migration median is calculated based on the numbers of migrating or stationary individuals, or a combination of the two.
