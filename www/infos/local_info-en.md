### Average number of stationary birds

#### What does the graph show?

The graph shows how many stationary individuals of a given species have been observed on average on a given calendar day. For example, birds breeding in the area and migrating individuals temporarily stopping at Uddskatan are considered stationary in Hanko Bird Observartory.  The graph is useful in examining the average timing of spring and autumn migration of a given species.

#### How are the values calculated?

The values in the graph are calculated by dividing the summed daily values of observed individuals with the number of times that calendar day has had observations. To make the graph easier to interpret, five-day (non-overlapping) averages have been used.
